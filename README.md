# E-commerce Shiping Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 10999 observations of 12 variables, including
customer id, warehouse block,mode of shipment, cost of the product, and other vairables related to International E-commerce company.
I made a new column (customer_rate_category) from the customer rate column to contain values to represent 
customer satisfaction instead of numbers.
The dataset can be found in kaggle through this website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics),
with feature documentation available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics?select=Train.csv).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that 33.3% of shipments come from warehouse f and each other warehouse contribute to 
16.6% of the shipments. 67.8% of the products are shipped using ship, 16.1% using flight and 16% using the road.
We can expect that we will have to make from 3 to 5 calls from enquiry for enquiry of the shipment.
40% of the customers rated the company as bad, 20% normal and 40% good.
The majority of product prices vary between 225$ and 280$, maximum cost of product is 310$, 
minimum cost of product is 96$ and average cost of product is 214$.
There is no significant difference between number of males and females in our customers, 60 % of the 
shippings were delievered on time, customers that have more prior purchases give the company better rate,
products with high importance have higher chance of being delievered on time, there are slight difference 
between modes of shipment in terms of delievring the products on time.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on emphasizing the factors that would make the customer more satisfied, 
and as a result make the business more successful, I start by introducing the distribution of the 
product prices, in order to know the category of products that sells the most, i also explain the 
proportion of each gender of our customers, then i show the most used mode of shipment and the rate 
of delievering the shipments on time for each mode and the proportion of shipments that was delieverd 
on time regardless of the mode of shipment.

Afterward, I explore the patterns and trends in the data like the relationship between the discount 
offered for each gender and the importance of the project, then the category of products that has the 
highest sales record, then the raltionship between product quality, gender and sales.
